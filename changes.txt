Summary of Changes
Early vs. Late Determinants
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Changes to minimize reliance on determinants and characteristic
polynomials for existing material for eigenvalues and eigenvectors

*  Intersection and sum of subspaces eventually necessary for
proving properties of the algebraic multiplicity of an eigenvalue,
especially theorem relating dimensions
New: Theorem SIIS, Definition SOS, Theorem SSIS, Theorem SID

*  Expand Example CAEHW and de-emphasize the notion that it is
the "hard way" with a new title and acronym, now Example CASE.

*  Formalize the basic connection between the singular matrix
A - lambda I and an eigenvalue lambda with new Theorem ESM.
Shortens proofs of Theorem ESM and Theorem EMRCP.

*  Move Theorem MNEM earlier, with a new proof that does not
use the characteristic polynomial.

*  Minor adjustment and enhancement of the phrasing of the
definition of similar matrices.

*  Expand conclusion of Theorem SMEE and improve proof to
only emply characteristic polynomial for algebraic multiplicities.

*  Simplify the proof of Theorem DED, without using
algebraic multiplicities.

*  Move definitions and results for triangular matrices.
Definitions UTM and LTM move from Section OD to Section MO,
with new Example ULTM.  Theorem NTM new in Section MO,
describes nonsingular triangular matrices, with Example NSTM
to illustrate.  Move Theorem PTMT about the product of
triangular matrices moves from Section OD to Section MM.
Move Theorem ITMT about inverses of triangular matrices
from Section OD to Section MINM, and improve the proof.

MAJOR SOURCE FORMAT CHANGE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Version 2.99 is the last version that is guaranteed to compile from the
LaTeX sources initiated in December 2003.  Content has all migrated
to an XML format, using a one-off conversion process, custom XML tags
and LaTeX syntax for in-line and displayed mathematics.

Changes to the LaTeX sources subsequent to Version 2.99 are
designed to support the automated conversion to XML and some
new environments (e.g. "introduction", "para", "graphics") are
not implemented in the corresponding style files.  Additional
content has been integrated, such as Tikz graphics and the Sage
vignettes.

v2.99 source (as published, or with additions) may be recreated
in two ways:
(a) rolling back to the version "2.99" Mercurial tag (published version)
(b) in the new "latex" subdirectory (source with additions).

v2.90  2012/06/17
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
MAJOR CHANGE:
    The inner product is now "reversed" from what it was formerly.
    Specifically, the entries of the *first* vector are conjugated now.
  Rationale:
    This will make properties for numerous matrix decompositions and other
    aspects of orthogonality simpler and more natural.  This is already
    evident as several proofs have been shortened and simplified.
  Changes:
    Definition IP - root cause
    Theorem IPSM - now scalar multiples of first vector
                   "come out" conjugated
    Theorem MMIP - conjugate and transpose both now affect first vector
    Theorem GSP - order in inner products reversed.  Necessary for the proof
                  but also preserves any existing computations
    Theorem COB - order in inner products reversed.  Necessary for the proof
                  but also preserves any existing computations
    Proofs - Many proofs depend on the five items above and have been
             rewritten.  Generally they are equivalent or simpler.  These
             changes are not documented here.  See the revision history, which
             is organized by section, or search on uses of the theorems above.
    Limitations - Changes only go through Section CB.  Remaining sections will
                  be adjusted as edited.
