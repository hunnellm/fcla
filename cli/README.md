# FCLA CLI/Runestone support

This directory contains a `project.ptx` designed **only**
to support an automated build on a Runestone Academy server,
via the use of the [PreTeXt-CLI](https://pypi.org/project/pretext/)
Python package.

In practice the CLI will add numerous files and output
directories here, but they are not being tracked by
`git` version control.
